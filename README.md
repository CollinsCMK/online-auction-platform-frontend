# online-auction-platform-frontend

This is the frontend component of an online auction platform built with Vue 3 in Vite. The platform allows users to bid on items in real-time auctions and includes WhatsApp notifications for auction events.

## Key Features

- View and bid on active auction listings
- Real-time auction status tracking (Upcoming, Active, Ended)
- Place bids at or above base price
- Track current best offers
- WhatsApp notifications for auction completion
- Admin interface for creating auction listings

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).
